            <p><em>“The Shopping Discovery Engine™”</em></p>
            
            <p><em>“We believe every woman should have a personal shopping experience that enables her to discover products she’ll love without having to scroll through the ones she doesn’t. That’s why we created it. At Styloko, enjoy bespoke product feeds that react in real-time to your browsing behavior; curated personal boutiques that enable you to save and keep track of favorite fashion finds (as well as shop the edits of other like-minded style-savvy women); and e-commerce enabled content that allows you to shop directly from inspiration.”</em></p>
            
            <p><em>– Styloko.com</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Styloko uses cutting edge technology to connect women with products they love. Our focus is to power shopping discovery by using data analysis and cutting edge technology.</strong></p>
            
            <p>There are 2 core aspects of the Styloko brand: The Style Hub, the editorial home where consumers can find the latest news from the fashion world; and the Styloko app, where users can discover, bookmark, and shop products from our partnered retailers.</p>

            <h2 id="the-problem---connecting-editorial-with-shopping">The Problem - connecting editorial with shopping</h2>
            <p>Alongside positioning Styloko as a leading player in the fashion tech industry, one of the main goals of The Style Hub is to drive traffic to the Styloko app. The idea is that users read and feel inspired by the great content on The Style Hub, and then buy products from Styloko app. In order to better facilitate this, we felt that we needed to create a more seamless integration between the editorial and shopping worlds and create 'shoppable content', where editorials on fashion trends could be supported by live products.</p>
            
            <p>And so we created the 'Trend Pages'.</p>
            
            <p>The purpose of each trend page was to provide a comprehensive guide to a given trend that was aspirational, informative and actionable. We wanted to educate users in the latest trends with  content that was seamlessly backed up with real and shoppable products.</p>
            
            <p>[IMAGE - Trend Page full view]</p>
            
            <p>The Trend Pages also needed an element of social proof, which was achieved by adding pictures of celebrities and images from social media showing photos of people out on the street sporting a given trend.</p>

            <h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
            
            <p>Because of the manual work required to gather this information, it would not be possible to have all of these in every single trend. So I adopted a 'modular' approach that allowed different combinations of the these sections to be used where the information was available, that did not lead to any of the pages feeling incomplete nor formulaic.</p>
            
            <p>Owing to fashions fast moving nature, we knew that the editorial team would have to be able to create new Trend Pages regularly in order to keep up with trends. So we bootstrapped an interface that the editorial team could use to quickly create an update trend pages independent of the development team.</p>
            
            <p>This would in turn mean that the number of Trend Pages would ever be increasing rapidly, and users would need a home (or index) where they could easily find the latest trends as well as peruse previous ones. To solve this need, I built the Trend Index page.</p>
            
            <p>[IMAGE - Trend Index]</p>
            
            <p>The Trend Index page highlights the latest Trends by ordering them newest-to-oldest, top-to-bottom. Each Trend is given a featured image, a title and a summary, allowing users can scan through them all quickly and easily.</p>
            
            <p>[IMAGE - Trend Index on mobile]</p>
            
            <h2 id="how-did-it-perform">How did it perform?</h2>
            <p>The Trend Pages remain a very popular feature on Styloko and always receive a large share of page views when they are released. They also have very long dwell times and low bounce rates, which indicates that users are sticking around and enjoying the content.</p>
            
            <p>The pages also performed well with regards to conversions, leading to an immediate increase after feature launch, and have continue to be a solid source of conversions on the Styloko site.</p>
            
            <h2 id="did-we-have-to-change-anything">Did we have to change anything?</h2>
            <p>Fashion is always moving forwards, which means that, other than the odd curious visitor once in a while, after a few weeks a Trend Page will stop receiving as many page views. This is something we had anticipated, and we now remove trends after a certain amount of time to ensure that what we are showing is still relevant.</p>
