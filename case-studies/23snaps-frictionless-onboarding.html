            <h2 id="what-is-23snaps">What is 23snaps?</h2>
            
            <p>23snaps allows parents to create a curated record of their children's special moments, and gives close family and friends a platform to feel a part of, and contribute to what is going on in their little relative's lives.</p>
            
            <div class="post-image">
            	<img src="../images/23snaps-devices.png" />
            </div>
            
            <p>A crucial factor to 23snaps success is that a family's content must be available to members of the family of all ages and digital confidence. It breaks down if Grandparents can't access photos on their email, for example, or if an Uncle on Android is unable to see posts from the parents on iOS. Therefore making 23snaps a cross-platform application, that is accessible across the board is paramount to success.</p>
            
            <p>The other crucial element to 23snaps is privacy. The content that people post on 23snaps, pertaining to their children, is some of the most precious, sensitive information a person can share. Therefore ensuring that users know that their content is completely secure and private to them and their connections alone is fundamental to building their trust in the product.</p>
            
            <h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Trying to grow a customer's network that is this strict on privacy, in an organic way can be quite difficult. It is inherently not a 'social network' so we can't rely on users connecting with other users freely in a viral manner. Therefore when we do acquire new users, ensuring they stay with us is crucial.</p>
            
            <p>Once we get a new user it is then a race against time to get them to sign up as many of the rest of their family as possible.    Our research shows that the more connections they have, the more likely they are to stick around and continue using the app. Interestingly, our research showed that the amount of content created by users didn't necessarily impact how long they stayed with us.</p>
            
            <p>We knew that if we wanted to keep more new users, we needed to remove friction from the onboarding process, and make it easier for them to invite their family members to the app.</p>
            
            <h2 id="how-do-you-remove-onboarding-friction">How do you remove onboarding friction?</h2>
            <p>Using tracking software, we could see our users dropping off at various points in the process, but we needed more information if we were to start penning solutions.</p>
            
            <p>Myself and a couple of members of the marketing team set up some usability testing sessions across a couple of weeks. We managed to get a small sample of parents (who had never seen or heard of the app before) to give up an hour or so of their time and go through the sign up process in front of us.</p>
            
            <p>Right from the get go, we learnt tonnes about what new users were experiencing when using the app. We started by getting users to install from the app store and then observed them as they negotiated their way through the sign up process; which includes creating profiles, adding children, and adding partners and other family members.</p>
            
            <p>We quickly found that users had a number of issues when trying to get set up. Here is a list of some of the key findings:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>User's didn't read the app store copy unprompted, so when entering the app for the first time, did not know straight away what it actually was or did.</li>
              <li>Users didn't were unable to find a number of key features, mostly because they were hidden from view by the slide out sidebar menu.</li>
              <li>Users found various points in the invite flow difficult or confusing.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>We did find some good things too:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>A lot of users (once they understood it) liked the concept of the app and identified with the problem of keeping a journal of their children's lives</li>
              <li>Most users saw privacy of their photos as something of a concern.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
            <p>From analysis of both our usability testing and our in-app tracking we identified the following courses of action:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Introduce a 'get started' walkthrough for when a user first enters the app.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Change the menu system from a pop out sidebar to a tab bar at the bottom of the screen.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Overhaul and simplify our invitation process.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 id="get-started-walkthrough">1. Get Started Walkthrough</h3>
            <p>This is also a common approach for apps to try to give the user an idea of the apps purpose and highlight the benefits of using the app. We decided to keep this to just 3 slides that highlighted 3 of the main tenets of the 23snaps product. Any fewer than 3 slides might mean we struggled to communicate our message to the user. But too many mean that users get tired or impatient and either skip the tutorial or exit the app entirely.</p>
            
            <div class="post-image">
            	<img src="../images/23snaps-welcome-screens.png" />
            </div>
            <p>### 2. Tab Menu
            The tab menu is a tried and tested approach to app navigation and seemed to suit our needs perfectly. One of the main benefits of this menu paradigm are that it does not hide any functionality, meaning that core features of the app are always in view (perfect for our users finding it difficult to navigate the app). Tab menus are also much more efficient than our previous slide out menu, as they require the user to make fewer taps (or clicks) to ravel through an app.</p>
            
            <div class="post-image">
            	<img src="../images/23snaps-tab-menu.png" />
            </div>
            <p>### 3. Overhaul and simplify the invitation process
            This step required a lot of thinking and work from our development team as the previous process had slowly evolved over time into a complex and mammoth beast. On the web app for example, we had many screens for the ways in which users might be invited to the app (we allow for SMS, email and third party invitations). To combat this we reduced the number of pages that the user encountered and opted for one invite screen that could be adapted to the various contexts. We also adjusted a lot of the messaging throughout the process to make it more concise and coherent.</p>
            
            <div class="post-image">
            	<img src="../images/23snaps-invite-screen.png" />
            </div>
            <p>## Did it work?
            During the implementation of the tab menu, we still had some usability testing sessions lined up, so we started trialling the new system with the participants and straight away we saw people navigating through the app with more fluidity and ease.</p>
            
            <p>The getting started walkthrough made an immediate impact on the number of new users that downloaded the app and then didn't manage to achieve any of our goals. We made sure to track how many people completed the walkthrough (didn't press skip), so we would know if users were finding it interesting and/or useful.</p>
            
            <p>The main goal of the invitation process overhaul was to increase the number of users that completed the process after being sent an invitation, which it succeeded in doing across almost all of our channels. I think there are ways in which we can improve this process even further, and in the future it should be easier after all of the hard refactoring that took place.</p>
