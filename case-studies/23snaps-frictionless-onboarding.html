            <h2 id="what-is-23snaps">What is 23snaps?</h2>
            <p><em>“23snaps is a private photo sharing app designed by parents, for parents. 23snaps gives you a completely safe and secure way to record the special moments in your child’s life and share them with your loved ones, wherever they may be in the world.”</em></p>
            
            <p><em>– 23snaps.com</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>23snaps allows parents to create a curated record of their children's lives, and gives close family and friends a platform to feel a part of, and contribute to what is going on in their little relative's lives.</strong></p>
            
            <p>A crucial factor to 23snaps success is that a family's content must be available to members of the family of all ages and digital confidence. It breaks down if Grandparents can't access photos on their email, for example, or if an Uncle on Android is unable to see posts from the parents on iOS. Therefore making 23snaps a cross-platform application, that is accessible across the board is paramount to success.</p>
            
            <p>The other crucial element to 23snaps is privacy. The content that people post on 23snaps, pertaining to their children, is some of the most precious, sensitive information a person can share. Therefore ensuring that users know that their content is completely secure and private to them and their connections alone is fundamental to building their trust in the product.</p>
            
            <h2 id="the-problems">The Problem(s)</h2>
            <p>Trying to grow a customer's network that is this strict on privacy, in an organic way can be quite difficult. It is inherently not a 'social network' so we can't rely on users connecting with other users freely in a viral manner. Therefore when we do acquire new users, ensuring that they stay with us is crucial.</p>
            
            <p>Once we get a new user it is then a race against time to get them to sign up as many of the rest of their family as possible.    Our research shows that the more connections they have, the more likely they are to stick around and continue using the app. Interestingly, research showed that the amount of content created by users didn't impact this anywhere near as strongly. So we would see users without connections, even content creating ones, would stop using the app after a short period of time.</p>
            
            <p>We knew that if we wanted to keep more new users, we needed to remove friction from the onboarding process, and make it easier for them to invite their family members to the app.</p>
            
            <h2 id="how-do-we-remove-onboarding-friction">How do we remove onboarding friction?</h2>
            <p>Using tacking software, we could see them dropping off at various points in the process, but we needed more information if we were to start penning solutions.</p>
            
            <p>Myself and a couple of members of the marketing team set up some usability testing sessions across a couple of weeks. We managed to get a small sample of parents (who had never seen or heard of the app before) to give up an hour or so of their time and go through the sign up process in front of us.</p>
            
            <p>This was the first time I had personally been involved in any usability testing, but we researched our method and it went very well. We learnt tonnes about what users got stuck on when entering the app. We started by getting users to install it from the app store and then guided (or watched) them through the sign up process, from creating their profiles, adding their children, and adding partners and other family members.</p>
            
            <p>We quickly found that users had a number of issues when trying to get set up. Here is a list of some of the key findings:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>User's didn't read the app store copy unprompted, so when entering the app for the first time, did not know straight away what it actually was or did.</li>
              <li>Users didn't know how to a lot of stuff mainly because it was hidden away in a pop out sidebar menu!</li>
              <li>Users found various points in the invite flow difficult or confusing.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>We did find some good things too:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>A lot of users (once they understood it) liked the concept of the app and identified with the problem of keeping a journal of their children's lives</li>
              <li>Most users saw privacy of their children's photos as something of a concern.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2 id="what-we-went-and-did">What we went and did</h2>
            <p>From analysis of both our usability testing and our in-app tracking we identified the following courses of action:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Introduce a 'get started' walkthrough for when a user first enters the app.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Change the menu system from a pop out sidebar to a tab bar at the bottom of the screen.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Overhaul and simplify our invitation process.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 id="get-started-walkthrough">1. Get Started Walkthrough</h3>
            <p>This is also a common approach for apps to try to give the user an idea of the apps purpose and highlight the benefits of using the app. We decided to keep this to just 3 slides that highlighted 3 of the main tenets of the 23snaps product. why?</p>
            
            <h3 id="tab-menu">2. Tab Menu</h3>
            <p>The tab menu is a widely adopted approach to app navigation and has two main benefits over a slide out menu in that it does not hide functionality and something else… (at the time, I also read this post which was very informative and contained links to valid research).</p>
            
            <h3 id="overhaul-and-simplify-the-invitation-process">3. Overhaul and simplify the invitation process</h3>
            <p>This step required a lot of thinking and work from our development team as the previous process had slowly evolved over time into a complex and mammoth beast. We refactored, simplified and redesigned a lot of the screens that users face during this process, as well as adjusting a lot of the copy so that was more clear and concise.</p>
            
            <h2 id="so-did-it-work">So… did it work?</h2>
            <p>During the implementation of the tab menu, we still had some usability testing sessions lined up, so we started trialling the new system with the participants and straight away we saw people navigating through the app with more fluidity and ease.</p>
            
            <p>The getting started walkthrough was a little more difficult to test as it wasn't ready in time for that round of testing (we should really be doing more, but honestly we haven't made the time for it), but we felt quite confident that if users were reading it – we were tracking how many people completed the walkthrough – then they would have a much clearer understanding of what 23snaps did than if they didn't.</p>
            
            <p>Overhauling the invitation process was easier to track as we had a number of KPIs to follow and improve. Although it is hard to say what, out of all of the changes we made, made the most impact to the improvement of these KPIs, overall people were passing through the process with greater success. There are no doubt many ways in which we can improve this further, but in the future they will be easier to implement after all of the hard refactoring that the process underwent.</p>
