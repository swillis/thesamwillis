<h2>My portfolio and (soon to be) blog</h2>

<p>Built using Bootstrap, Hammer and Takana.</p>

<p>I have built this site thinking about mobile first and web second. The aim is to make a cross platform experience that is fast, responsive, useful, accessible and fun (but not necessarily in that order).</p>

<h2>Get it up and running</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Clone the repo from Github</li>
  <li>Download and install the Hammer app</li>
  <li>Download and install Takana</li>
  <li>Add the project to Hammer app and run it in your browser*!</li>
</ul>

<p>*Images coming soon.</p>
