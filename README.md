## My portfolio and (soon to be) blog

Built using Bootstrap, Hammer and Takana.

I have built this site thinking about mobile first and web second. The aim is to make a cross platform experience that is fast, responsive, useful, accessible and fun (but not necessarily in that order).

## Get it up and running

- Clone the repo from Github
- Download and install the Hammer app
- Download and install Takana
- Add the project to Hammer app and run it in your browser*!

*Images coming soon.
