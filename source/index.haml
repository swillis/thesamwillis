					%p Design+Banter is a meetup for Designers organised by myself and GearÃ³id O'Rourke. Every month ~200 Designers get together to trade stories, share ideas, and have a few drinks too.

					%p If you are a Designer, you should come! If you would like to speak at or sponsor a future event, I would love to hear from you.
